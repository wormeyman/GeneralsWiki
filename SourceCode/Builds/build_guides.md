# Build Guides

This page provides an overview of the official and community-supported build guides for **TheSuperHackers** project. It
includes both the official build guides for the main repository and guides for community forks of the project. The
guides cover different environments, configurations, and setups for building the project.

## Build Configurations Overview

Before diving into the build guides, it's important to understand the different build configurations used in the
project. These configurations dictate how the project is built, whether for debugging, profiling or release.

- **Release:** Optimized for end-users, providing a smaller, faster executable with no debugging information.
- **Debug:** Includes debugging information, making it easier to trace and debug the code, but without optimization to
  ensure ease of debugging.
- **Profile:** Used for performance profiling, with optimizations enabled and additional debugging options to collect
  profiling data.

Each configuration is designed for a different purpose, whether you're building for development, debugging, testing, or
releasing the final product. You can find more details about the build configurations in
the [Build Configurations](build_configuration) page.

> **⚠️ Debug Build Requirements:** To run a debug build of the game, you need to have  
> the following two files in the game directory alongside the built executable:
>
> - [`MSVCRTD.DLL`](https://github.com/TheSuperHackers/GeneralsWiki/raw/refs/heads/main/SourceCode/Builds/files/MSVCRTD.DLL)  
>   Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library (Debug)
> - [`MSVCIRTD.DLL`](https://github.com/TheSuperHackers/GeneralsWiki/raw/refs/heads/main/SourceCode/Builds/files/MSVCIRTD.DLL)  
>   Microsoft Visual C++ Internationalization Runtime Library (Debug)

## Architectures and Toolchains

The project supports multiple architectures and toolchains, which is why there are various build guides tailored to
different environments. An **architecture** refers to the target platform, such as **x86** (32-bit) or **x64** (64-bit),
while a **toolchain** is the set of tools (compilers, linkers, etc.) used to build the project. Different toolchains may
support different optimizations, libraries, or debugging features that influence how the build process is conducted.

> The Wiki is under work in progress. The content is subject to change and may not be complete.
> Not all build guides are available yet, but you can contribute by adding new guides or updating existing ones.

## CMake Overview

This [CMake Guide](cmake_guide) provides an overview of how to configure and build **Generals** and its expansion
*Zero Hour* using **CMake** via the command line. It covers the various options and flags defined in the CMake files that
control the build process, allowing you to choose different components of the game and tools to build.

## Official Build Guides
